Basic-Parser JS
===============

An exercise in language parsing I started my senior year of high school and I have been working working on
occasionally since.

This is a continuation of my Basic-Parser, which was going to be not only a language parser but also a runtime environment. I changed the goal to be syntactic sugar to compile to Javascript and eventually other languages such as Java or Python.
