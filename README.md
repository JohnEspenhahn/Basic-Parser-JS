Basic-Parser JS
===============

After more than a year of development, what started as an idea for the "Stackey" language (see more here: https://github.com/JohnEspenhahn/Parser-0.x) is a working compiler. 

This is a continuation of my Basic-Parser (https://github.com/JohnEspenhahn/Basic-Parser) targeted toward compilation to Javascript and eventually other languages such as Java or C++.

For more information on the language (w.i.p. name Basic) see readme.html
