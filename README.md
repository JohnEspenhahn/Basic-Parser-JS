Basic-Parser
============

After more than a year of development, what started as an idea for the "Stackey" language (see more here: https://github.com/JohnEspenhahn/Parser-0.x) is a working compiler. 

It currently only compiles to bytecode for the DCPU-32 (https://comatose-hahn.rhcloud.com/), but I plan to allow selection of a target language. That languages may include C, Javascript, and Java.

For more information on the language (w.i.p. name Basic) see readme.html
